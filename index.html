            <strong>I'm 33 years old. I'm a German-Mexican, Dad. 
                I have a wife, and a 1 year old son with another child on the way. 
                (I know, two under two, save me) And that is a big reason why I am trying to become a Computer Programmer so my wife doesnt have to take on most of the burden of finances for our family. 
                I was born and raised between Texas and Colorado. I now live in Dayton OH and have been here for about 7 years. 
                I moved here because my dad got relocated for his job and so I decided to move along with them to stay close.</strong>

            <strong>Music, besides family, is the most important thing to me. It has gotten me through tough times, that I could not see myself getting through.
                For me, I can do anything while having music on around me. Unlike most, who need complete silence to focus, I use music to keep me focused in on
                things that I have to really think about. I have a very wide range of music selection that I choose on depending on my mood. My Favorite type of music
                 to listen to is Pop Punk/Emo. When it was at its peek was the perfect time in my life because I was in highschool and we all know that highschool can be 
                rough. My Favorite Artist is Brand New and my favorite album is also by Brand New, called Deja Entendu. I also listen to Rap, Rock, and the occasional Pop and Oldies (like Motown).
                Some of my favorite Artists include: Brand New, The Weeknd, The Used, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, J Cole, and Taking Back Sunday, to name a few. If you would like to see some 
                of the playlists ive made on Spotify, check out my profile. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1251721231?si=VYIee_m8QXyM-AK--Eqgfg&utm_source=copy-link">Travis Morris</a>

            <strong>Growing up for a short time in Denver CO means alot to me. Being in Texas most of my life, you dont get alot of different weather/seasons. Its either too hot and summer, or its winter. which is like a cooler fall
                 in most places in the north. I love cold weather, and hate hot weather. Colorado got hot at points but from what I remember, or romanticize as some would say, about Colorado is the weather was usually fair most of the year.
                With the age I was, I started to grasp on different things like sports and have held on to those things since. If it was up to me, and not my wife, I would move back there yesterday. But i will say Ohio atleast has the seasons 
                like Colorado and it will have to do since both of our families are here.</strong>
